inkognitor
==========

The "Kettensturm"-LARP of the ACME-orga was set in the First World War, where
the German Army managed to possess alien technology.
With this technology they built the "Inkognitor", an early computer, around
the brain of an alien species.

This code was used to simulate this computer.

It's quiet specific to this special LARP and therefore of little use for
anybody else.
Further, it uses an Arduino to control some external, home-brew hardware, which
isn't documented.

It also suffers from a lot of last minute-changes, since the convention
got closer and closer. I'm unwilling to clean it up, since I don't assume I'll
ever use this code again.

Anyway, it's kept here for historic reasons -- and because some of the
participators of the convention asked for it :o)
